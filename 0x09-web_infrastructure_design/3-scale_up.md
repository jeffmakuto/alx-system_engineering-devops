# Scaled-Up Web Infrastructure

## Design Explanation:

### User Accesses the Website:

* As before, a user wants to access www.foobar.com in their web browser.

### Load Balancer (HAProxy Cluster):

* A load balancer cluster is configured with two instances of HAProxy to distribute incoming traffic. This enhances redundancy and load balancing capabilities.

### Server 1 and Server 2:

* These servers are introduced for redundancy and improved performance. Components are split across these servers to balance the load.

### Web Server (Nginx):

* The web server remains responsible for handling HTTP requests from users' browsers.

### Application Server:

* The application server is on a separate server, ensuring that the application code is isolated from the web server.

### Database Server (MySQL):

* The database is hosted on its own server, providing dedicated resources for database operations.

## Additional Component Explanation:

* Load Balancer Cluster: Using a cluster of HAProxy instances further improves redundancy and high availability. If one HAProxy instance fails, the other can continue to distribute traffic. It also allows for better load balancing of incoming requests.

## Scaling Up and Advantages:

* Scalability: This design is more scalable than the previous one. You can easily add more application servers or database servers to handle increased traffic or load.

* Isolation: Splitting components onto separate servers enhances isolation, allowing each component to have its dedicated resources, which can lead to improved performance and easier management.

* Redundancy: The use of multiple servers and a load balancer cluster adds redundancy, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

* Load Balancer Cluster: A load balancer cluster enhances the reliability of the load balancing solution, as it can continue distributing traffic even if one instance fails.
